The Zeitgeist node monitoring program provides a visual node monitoring platform for Zeitgeist node operators, based on [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) and [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus). It aims to give node operators an easy-to-use and intuitive embodiment of node information. We pre-designed a [dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/15424) to visualize some key information, and we also support our own customized dashboard to monitor personal data.

## Get Started

Zeitgeist node release information: https://github.com/zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist/releases

You can use [this article](./how-to-monitor-node-en.md) to deploy the node monitoring program.

## Customized interface

In addition to the data in our pre-designed dashboard, you can also customize the dashboard by adding or deleting interfaces. Here we provide a [interface document](./metrics.md) currently supported by the Zeitgeist node.
